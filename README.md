> Generate a PrestaShop store

This generator scaffolds a fresh PrestaShop store. For now, it can only grab the the latest stable release and unzip ip for you. More features are coming.
## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-prestashop using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-prestashop
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo prestashop
```

## TODO
- [x] Quickly fetch the latest release by typing `yo prestashop`
- [ ] Add a progress bar when extracting the archive
- [ ] Select the PrestaShop version to download
- [ ] Skip the browser installation process

## Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He&#39;s a person with feelings and opinions, but he&#39;s very easy to work with. If you think he&#39;s too opinionated, he can be easily convinced. Feel free to [learn more about him](http://yeoman.io/).
